"""Golden-file regression tests for the F5OS extractor.

These tests run end-to-end ``extract_qkview`` against the three F5OS qkview
shapes we currently support (rSeries host, VELOS partition, VELOS syscon)
and pin the metadata + structural invariants we care about most:

  * the running F5OS version pulled from PRODUCT (not from `show system
    licensing`, which reports the *licensed* version even when the running
    image has been upgraded),
  * the platform identifier — VELOS partition archives must report the
    local ``controller`` platform, not whichever blade happens to appear
    first in the peer-qkview wrapper,
  * the ``k8s_*`` subpackage skip — VELOS syscon archives ship ~40
    kubernetes / openshift pod wrappers we deliberately exclude from
    discovery and from the log index.

Each archive is extracted exactly once per test session via the
session-scoped fixtures in ``conftest.py``. Extracting all three takes
2–6 minutes wall-clock on this host; if the archives are missing the
tests are skipped automatically.

Baseline values come from session 7 of SESSION_STATE.md (2026-04-18).
Update them when the source archives change.
